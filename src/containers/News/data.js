This was in 2010, our company had 12 people and one of our top clients asked us if we could put one of our recruiters onsite to take over their recruiting efforts. As most small companies would, we said yes, didn’t ask enough questions, and dove in headfirst."},

And this will most likely involve a sales funnel, because more likely than not, 30 companies aren’t guaranteed to jump in the boat. Smart companies approach recruiting in the same manner: They think backwards. If you want to hire 30 people, how many interviews are your hiring managers going to have to conduct? How many phone interviews need to happen? How many resumes do your recruiters need to review?"},

Secondly, offer something more than just a generic workshop with a one-size-fits-all approach. Employees are demanding more from their health at work packages – DNA testing, one-to-one specialist health coaching and personalized wearable tech now being the norm. "},

            {text: "Zero hours contracts have quite rightly attracted a lot of criticism, for the extent to which they’ve been abused by businesses to the detriment of employees’ rights. But might jobseekers actually start to demand them in 2019? And what does this mean for recruiters and the industry as a whole as more workers potentially look into different employment models to suit their need for flexibility rather than opt for full-time positions? Oliver Shaw of Cascade HR, offers his thoughts…"},
            {text: "They’ve been hailed as exploitative, have featured heavily in employment tribunals and have been a topic of focus on the picket line – it’s no wonder zero hours contracts have attracted a bad reputation! And rightly so – in many cases they’re abused by employers in a blasé act of stripping staff of some arguably extremely basic entitlements. As a recruiter, that’s not exactly the kind of fit that you want when you are looking for the very best talent."},
            {video: "CFR4AA15Rmk"},
            {text: "Whilst the very nature of these casual arrangements makes statistics difficult to ascertain, an article in The Guardian in October 2018 suggested that almost 1 million people in the UK are employed on this basis – around a fifth of the 2000 figure. Despite the Labour Government’s attempts to have them ruled as illegal, they therefore show no sign of disappearing from the employment landscape just yet."},
            {text: "But is this a bad thing?"},
            {text: "Of course, their exploitation cannot be condoned in any way, but abuse of zero hours contracts is arguably a cultural and/or ethical issue on the part of the employer, rather than a direct fault of the model itself. Because let’s make an important recap – these contracts are supposed to provide flexibility on the part of both the employing organisation and the worker. And as a recruiter, you want to keep that kind of relationship going."},
            {text: "So, whilst there are undoubtedly people who would rather have more security and regular hours – almost half of the people on such contracts according to the Guardian article – there will also be some who welcome the fluidity that comes with zero hours arrangements. A very similar debate in fact surrounds the gig economy too – this model is also advantageous to certain people. And recruiters should be reactive to this when finding the right kind of role for jobseekers."},

            {text: "Firstly, you must persuade recruiters to open your CV. Even the best CV in the world is useless if it sits unopened in a recruiter’s inbox. To ensure that recruiters open your CV in the first place, you must include a powerful cover note to tempt them in. Keep your cover note short and sharp to save the reader time and provide a summary of how your skills and experience match the job advert requirements. Remember to address the recruiter by name and write in a friendly tone to create a good impression and start to build a rapport with them."},

            {text: "Once a recruiter has opened your CV, the first thing they will do, is spend an initial 6-10 seconds scanning the CV for the essential skills and knowledge. This is initial scan is just to ensure that your CV has enough of the role’s candidate requirements, before they invest the time read your CV in full. If your CV doesn’t pass this quick scan, then it’s likely that the recruiter will close your CV down and move on to the next one. To ensure that your CV makes an instant impact when opened, make it easy to read and highlight the skills that are relevant to your target roles. Use a clear simple font, break text up, structure the pages well and make your relevant talents prominent."},
            {title: "Recruiters scare easily"},
            {text: "Recruiters work hard to maintain good relationships with hiring managers and providing bad candidates can seriously damage those relationships. For this reason, recruiters are very careful about which CVs they recommend for positions. Things like gaps in employment and sloppy formatting can be enough to worry recruiters into leaving out of the shortlist. Don’t give recruiters any chance to doubt you; ensure that your CV looks professional and has no deal-breaking mistakes."},
